Some info from here: http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/systemdesign/dice-methods.html


### Base dice rolls?: bell-curve(3d6) vs linear(1d20)
linear is going to have totally even distribution
bell curve has more focused on the high end and low end.

### Roll-and-add:
roll the dice, add it to the stat, and see if the roll is over the difficulty
